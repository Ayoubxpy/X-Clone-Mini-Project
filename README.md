## ‚ú® Features & Skills Learned

This project was built from the ground up and showcases a wide range of essential frontend development skills:

*   **Dynamic HTML Rendering:** Generating the entire tweet feed from a JavaScript data object using template literals.
*   **Event Handling:** Using a single event listener on the `document` to efficiently manage all user interactions (likes, retweets, replies).
*   **Data Attributes:** Leveraging `data-*` attributes to pass unique IDs from the HTML to JavaScript, connecting UI elements to their corresponding data.
*   **Array Manipulation:**
    *   Using `.forEach()` to iterate over data arrays and build HTML.
    *   Using methods like `.filter()` or `.find()` to locate specific objects within an array based on their ID.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Modifying object properties (e.g., `likes`, `retweets`, `isLiked`) to update the application's state.
    *   Toggling boolean values with the logical NOT operator (`!`) to track state changes.
*   **Conditional Rendering & Styling:**
    *   Applying CSS classes dynamically (e.g., a "liked" class) to reflect state changes in the UI.
    *   Using `.classList.toggle()` to show and hide reply sections.
*   **External Libraries:**
    *   Integrating **Font Awesome** via a CDN to add icons.
    *   Using the **UUID** library via a CDN to generate unique identifiers for new tweets.
